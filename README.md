Hey there 👋🏾 

My name is Yevonnie (YEH-vuh-nee) 🙂

I am a clinical social worker who is studying to become a frontend developer. I'm starting to get the hang of HTML5, CSS3 and version control. I'm currently learning Javascript. Check out what I've done so far. Your suggestions and/or comments are welcome.

Here are some things that interest me 🙂: 

- open source and collaboration
- meeting other developers
- chocolate (dark)
- good food 
- dancing 💃 
- learning and growing in the tech community
