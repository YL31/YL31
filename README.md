I am a clinical social worker who is studying to become a frontend developer. I am currently learning HTML5, CSS3 and version control. Soon I'll be getting into Javascript. Check out what I've done so far. Your suggestions and/or comments are welcome.

Here are some things that interest me 🙂: 

- open source and collaboration
- meeting other developers
- chocolate (dark)
- good food 
- dancing 💃 
- learning and growing in the tech community
